# Feature Specification: Job Search Aggregation & Filtering

**Feature Branch**: `001-feature-job-search`  
**Created**: 10 Eyl√ºl 2025 √áar≈üamba  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Feature: Job Search Aggregation & Filtering

Context:
- Monorepo: JobFlux
- Apps: `apps/web`, `apps/api`
- Service: `services/scraper`
- Infra: `infra/terraform`
- Memory rules: `memory/constitution.md` (contracts first, tests + observability mandatory, security by default)

Requirements:
1. API endpoint in `apps/api` to query aggregated job listings.
   - Input: query params (title, location, tags, salary range).
   - Output: paginated job list, JSON schema strict.
2. Web integration in `apps/web` for `/search` page.
   - Interactive filters, accessible UI.
3. Scraper service contract update in `services/scraper`.
   - Normalized job schema, deduplication rules.
4. DB migration (if needed): indexes on job title + location.
5. Non-functional:
   - Latency: p95 < 200ms for search.
   - Availability: 99.9%.
   - Security: authenticated requests, no PII leakage.
   - Observability: logs, metrics, traces for search path.

Deliverables:
- `specs/job-search/system-overview.md`
- `specs/job-search/api/openapi.yaml`
- `specs/job-search/db/migrations.sql`
- `specs/job-search/events/job-schema.md`
- `specs/job-search/nonfunctional.md`

Style:
- Precise, unambiguous.
- Use real request/response examples.
- Every interface must include method, path, auth, schema, error codes, idempotency.
- DB migrations must include forward + rollback SQL.
- Include rollout plan and kill-switch flag."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a job seeker, I want to search for jobs on the JobFlux platform, so that I can find relevant job opportunities. I want to be able to filter the job listings by title, location, tags, and salary range to narrow down my search results.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the `/search` page, **When** they enter "Software Engineer" in the title filter and "London" in the location filter, **Then** the system should display a paginated list of software engineer jobs in London.
2. **Given** a user is viewing a list of jobs, **When** they apply a salary range filter of "$100,000 - $150,000", **Then** the system should only show jobs within that salary range.
3. **Given** a user has applied multiple filters, **When** they click the "clear filters" button, **Then** all filters are removed and the full list of jobs is displayed.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user enters a search query that returns no results? The system should display a user-friendly message indicating that no jobs were found matching the criteria.
- How does the system handle invalid input in the filter fields? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the expected behavior for invalid filter inputs, e.g., non-numeric values in salary range?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide an API endpoint at `apps/api` to query aggregated job listings.
- **FR-002**: The API endpoint MUST accept query parameters for `title`, `location`, `tags`, and `salary range`.
- **FR-003**: The API endpoint MUST return a paginated list of jobs in a strict JSON schema.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST provide a web interface at `/search` in the `apps/web` application.
- **FR-005**: The search interface MUST have interactive filters for `title`, `location`, `tags`, and `salary range`.
- **FR-006**: The UI of the search page MUST be accessible. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What specific accessibility standards should be followed, e.g., WCAG 2.1 AA?]
- **FR-007**: The scraper service in `services/scraper` MUST have an updated contract with a normalized job schema.
- **FR-008**: The scraper service MUST include deduplication rules for job listings. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the specific rules for deduplication? Based on job title and company? URL?]
- **FR-009**: The system MUST create database indexes on job `title` and `location` if they do not exist.
- **FR-010**: All requests to the search API endpoint MUST be authenticated. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What authentication method should be used? API Key, JWT, etc.?]
- **FR-011**: The system MUST NOT leak any Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: The p95 latency for the search API endpoint MUST be less than 200ms.
- **NFR-002**: The search service MUST have an availability of 99.9%.
- **NFR-003**: The system MUST provide logs, metrics, and traces for the entire search path for observability.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Job**: Represents a job listing. Attributes include: `title`, `location`, `tags`, `salary_range`, `description`, `company`, `url`.
- **User**: Represents a user of the platform. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the user attributes relevant to job searching? Do we store search history?]

## Deliverables
- `specs/job-search/system-overview.md`
- `specs/job-search/api/openapi.yaml`
- `specs/job-search/db/migrations.sql`
- `specs/job-search/events/job-schema.md`
- `specs/job-search/nonfunctional.md`

## Style Guide Adherence
- The specification will be precise and unambiguous.
- Real request/response examples will be used in the `openapi.yaml`.
- Interfaces will include method, path, auth, schema, error codes, and idempotency details in the `openapi.yaml`.
- DB migrations in `migrations.sql` will include both forward and rollback SQL statements.
- A rollout plan and a kill-switch flag will be documented in the `system-overview.md`.
