# Implementation Plan: Job Search Aggregation & Filtering

**Branch**: `002-feature-job-search` | **Date**: 10 Eylül 2025 Çarşamba | **Spec**: [link](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-feature-job-search/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   - Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

## Summary
This plan outlines the implementation of a job search aggregation and filtering feature. The core of this feature is a new API endpoint for querying job listings and a web interface to interact with it. The plan follows a spec-driven development approach, starting with research to clarify ambiguities, followed by design of the data model and API contracts, and finally task planning.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: API: Python 3.11, Web: TypeScript 5.2
**Primary Dependencies**: API: FastAPI, Web: React, Next.js, Data: SQLAlchemy
**Storage**: PostgreSQL
**Testing**: API: pytest, Web: Jest, Cypress
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web Application (Frontend + Backend)
**Performance Goals**: p95 latency < 200ms for search, 99.9% availability.
**Constraints**: Authenticated requests, no PII leakage.
**Scale/Scope**: Initial launch targeting 10,000 users and 1 million job listings.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Simplicity**:
- Projects: 3 (api, web, scraper)
- Using framework directly? Yes.
- Single data model? Yes.
- Avoiding patterns? Yes.

**Architecture**:
- EVERY feature as library? No.
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:
- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes.
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes.
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes.
- Real dependencies used? Yes.
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes.
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes.

**Observability**:
- Structured logging included? Yes.
- Frontend logs → backend? Yes.
- Error context sufficient? Yes.

**Versioning**:
- Version number assigned? Yes, v1.
- BUILD increments on every change? Yes.
- Breaking changes handled? Yes.

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Research tasks for all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] points.
2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   - Research technology stack (Language, Dependencies, Storage, Testing).
   - Research best practices for performance, security, and observability.
3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`.

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`.
2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements → `/contracts/openapi.yaml`.
3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts.
4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories → integration tests.
5. **Update agent file incrementally**.

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `/contracts/openapi.yaml`, failing tests, `quickstart.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design documents.
- Each API endpoint → contract test task.
- Each data model → model creation task.
- Each user story → integration test task.
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass.

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation.
- Dependency order: Models before services before API/UI.

**Estimated Output**: A list of ordered tasks in `tasks.md`.

## Progress Tracking
